        <h2>Daniel Ricciardo - Full Biography</h2>

        <h3 id="early-life">Early life</h3>
        <p>
          Daniel Joseph Ricciardo was born on 1 July 1989 in Perth, Western
          Australia, to Italian-Australian parents. His father, Giuseppe "Joe"
          Ricciardo, was born in Ficarra (Messina), but relocated to Australia
          with his family at the age of seven. Ricciardo's mother, Grace
          Pulitanò was born in Australia, but had parents originally from
          Casignana (Calabria). Ricciardo also has a sister, Michelle. Growing
          up in Duncraig, Ricciardo's earliest memories of motorsports were of
          his father racing at the nearby Barbagallo Raceway in Wanneroo. Raised
          Catholic, he attended high school at Newman College. He started
          karting at the age of 9.

        <h3 id="early-career">Early career</h3>
        <br />
        <h4 id="karting">Karting, Formula Ford and Formula BMW</h4>
        <p>
          Ricciardo started karting at the age of nine as a member of the Tiger
          Kart Club (TKC) and entered numerous karting events.
          <br />
          In 2005, he entered the Western Australian Formula Ford championship
          driving a 15-year-old Van Diemen, finishing eighth by the season's
          end.
          <br />
          <br />
          Towards the end of the 2005 season, Ricciardo took a leased
          13-year-old Van Diemen across to Sandown Raceway in Melbourne to
          compete at the national Formula Ford series, but his aging car was
          uncompetitive, and he finished 16th, 17th and retired during the
          weekend's three races.
          <br />
          <br />
          That year, Ricciardo was more successful in karts, in which he was
          crowned the Australian champion. His prizes for the win included a
          pass to the 2006 Australian Grand Prix at Albert Park, Melbourne,
          where the then-16-year-old savoured a taste of his own future by
          chatting unnoticed with Italian driver Jarno Trulli and Miss Universe
          2004, Jennifer Hawkins.
          <br />
          <br />
          After finishing sixth in 2007 Formula Renault 2.0 Italia, Ricciardo
          was selected by the Red Bull Junior Team.
        </p>

        <h4 id="f3">Formula Three</h4>
        <p>
          During the mid-part of the 2008 season, Ricciardo made his Formula
          Three debut at the Nürburgring, joining SG Formula's Formula 3 Euro
          Series team. Despite only a short amount of experience in the car,
          Ricciardo qualified in eighth for the first race, which later
          converted into sixth in the race after James Jakes and Christian
          Vietoris stalled on the grid. But he struggled in the reverse-grid
          race, finishing just fifteenth.
          <br />
          <br />
          Ricciardo moved to the British Formula 3 Championship for the 2009
          season driving for Carlin Motorsport. Ricciardo continued his
          partnership with Carlin by heading to the Macau Grand Prix with the
          team.
        </p>

        <h4 id="formula-renault">Formula Renault 3.5 Series</h4>
        <p>
          On 30 October 2009, Ricciardo was signed by Tech 1 to compete in the
          2010 season. He had competed with the team at the Autódromo
          Internacional do Algarve in Portugal in 2009 and was the teammate to
          Brendon Hartley, another driver who drove for Tech 1 over the season.
          <br />
          <br />
          Following a minor incident during a mountain bike exercise, Ricciardo
          was forced to miss the second test of the 2010 season but went on to
          take pole position for both races at the season-opening round of the
          2010 season in Alcañiz, Spain. He finished third and second in the
          races respectively, to leave himself at the head of the championship
          standings. Two weeks later, at the Spa-Francorchamps circuit,
          Ricciardo was relegated to last on the grid after being deemed to have
          hindered the laps of other drivers. In the next two races, he finished
          13th and fifth respectively coming 2nd in the latter, until many of
          the front-runners were given penalties for infringing the parc ferme
          rules before the race. One week later, in Monte Carlo, Ricciardo
          secured his third pole position of the season, finishing three-tenths
          of a second ahead of championship rival Stefano Coletti. He secured
          his first win at the following race, one place ahead of Coletti.
          Ricciardo went on to secure two more wins at the Hungaroring and at
          the Hockenheimring in commanding fashion. Following Ricciardo's sixth
          pole from 12 races, Tech 1 team boss, Simon Abadie, praised his
          driver's efforts greatly, saying, "I am happy, and happy for Daniel
          because six poles in 12 races is good going," and later stated his
          team's ambitions for success, by telling Autosport correspondent Peter
          Mills, "I really hope Daniel wins the championship."
          <br />
          <br />
          At the first race at the Silverstone circuit, Ricciardo was involved
          in a spectacular incident with pole-sitter Jon Lancaster, in which
          Ricciardo was sent into a barrel roll, eventually landing on his
          wheels. The crash saw the end of his race, with teammate Jean-Éric
          Vergne becoming the eventual winner, following disqualifications.
          Securing pole for the second race of the weekend, Ricciardo spent much
          of the race leading the pack by upwards of three seconds. However,
          braking issues in the second half of the event meant that, on the
          final lap, championship-rival Esteban Guerrieri was able to pass the
          Tech 1 racer.
          <br />
          <br />
          Going into the final round of the season, Ricciardo sat just three
          points behind championship leader Mikhail Aleshin and 13 ahead of
          third-place man Esteban Guerrieri. Managing his 8th pole of the
          season, Ricciardo managed a lights-to-flag victory, setting the
          fastest lap and placing himself equal first with one race remaining.
          After securing second place on the grid for the second race of the
          weekend, Ricciardo managed to hold position until the pit stops, where
          he was successfully 'jumped' by two of his rivals, including teammate
          Vergne. With only two laps left in the race and struggling for pace,
          Ricciardo was overtaken by championship rival Aleshin. Finishing in
          that order, Ricciardo failed to secure the title in his debut year,
          losing out to Mikhail Aleshin by only two points.
          <br />
          <br />
          In 2011 Ricciardo raced for ISR Racing prior to his HRT call-up.

        <h4 id="debut">Debut as Red Bull test driver (2009-2011)</h4>
        <p>
          Ricciardo made his track debut at the wheel of a Formula One car when
          he tested for Red Bull Racing at the young drivers test at Circuito de
          Jerez over three days, starting on 1 December 2009.
          <br />
          On the final day of testing, he clocked the fastest time of the test
          by over a second. This placed him as the only driver to go into the
          1:17 bracket.
          <br />
          Red Bull Racing's team manager Christian Horner suggested that
          Ricciardo may replace his 2010 World Series teammate Hartley as the
          team's test and reserve driver. Ricciardo and Hartley went on to share
          test and reserve duties for both Red Bull and sister team Scuderia
          Toro Rosso until the latter was removed from the Red Bull Junior team.
          <br />
          <br />
          On 11 November 2010, Ricciardo was confirmed as the single driver to
          represent Red Bull Racing at the end-of-season young driver's test at
          the Yas Marina Circuit, on 16-17 November. Ricciardo continued to show
          his one-lap prowess and dominated the event, with his fastest lap
          being 1.3 seconds faster than 2010 World Champion Sebastian Vettel's
          qualifying lap the Saturday before.
          <br />
          <br />
          Days later, Ricciardo was confirmed as Toro Rosso's test and reserve
          driver for the 2011 season and would take part in the first free
          practice session of each race weekend. Franz Tost, Toro Rosso team
          principal stated that "having a hungry youngster on the books will
          keep our current driver pairing nice and sharp", referring to then
          Toro Rosso drivers Jaime Alguersuari and Sébastien Buemi.

        <br />

        <h4 id="hrt">HRT (2011)</h4>
        <p>
          On 30 June 2011, Ricciardo was contracted to Hispania Racing by Red
          Bull Racing, replacing Narain Karthikeyan for the remaining races of
          the 2011 season (excepting the Indian Grand Prix, to allow Karthikeyan
          to race at his home Grand Prix). Ricciardo made his Grand Prix debut
          at the 2011 British Grand Prix at Silverstone Circuit.
          <br />
          <br />
          However, on 22 October 2011, a few days before the inaugural Indian
          Grand Prix, the race where Karthikeyan was due to gain back his seat
          for his home race HRT F1 announced that Vitantonio Liuzzi made way for
          Karthikeyan, allowing Ricciardo to race in India and extend his
          learning curve that Red Bull Racing paid the struggling Spanish team
          to do, as well as allowing Karthikeyan to race in front of his home
          fans.
          <br />
          In Abu Dhabi, Ricciardo retired with mechanical problems after
          starting 20th on the grid, and in the final race at the Brazilian
          Grand Prix, Ricciardo finished 20th after starting 22nd on the grid.

        <p id="2012"><strong>2012</strong></p>
        <p>
          On 14 December 2011, it was confirmed that Ricciardo would drive for
          Scuderia Toro Rosso for the 2012 season, alongside Frenchman Jean-Éric
          Vergne.
          <br />
          <br />
          At the Australian Grand Prix on 18 March, Ricciardo managed to
          overtake his teammate Vergne late on the last lap to come home in
          ninth place, securing his first two World Championship points.
          <br />
          <br />
          In wet conditions in Malaysia, he finished 12th, after having been
          first to switch to slick tyres. In Bahrain, he qualified sixth, but
          dropped back during the race and finished 15th. In Monaco, he suffered
          his only retirement of the season, after having started from 15th
          position. Ricciardo would score points again only after the summer
          break, at the Belgian Grand Prix, where he started from 16th and
          finished ninth. He also had a run of three consecutive points scores
          from the Singapore to the Korean Grand Prix. He scored one more points
          finish in Abu Dhabi for the year, ending tenth. Ricciardo finished
          18th in the championship, with 10 points.

        <p id="2013"><strong>2013</strong></p>
        <p>
          Toro Rosso re-signed Ricciardo and Jean-Éric Vergne for the 2013
          season.
          <br />
          <br />
          He began the year by not finishing the opening two rounds, both due to
          exhaust issues. In China, Ricciardo scored his first points of the
          year after finishing seventh, claiming his best finish in F1 by far.
          He finished tenth at the Spanish Grand Prix, despite a slow start from
          11th on the grid. Ricciardo again was unable to finish the Monaco
          Grand Prix after Romain Grosjean crashed into the back of him,
          damaging his rear wing. At the British Grand Prix, Ricciardo had his
          best qualifying yet in fifth. Despite being overtaken by faster cars
          behind, he still snatched points with eighth place.
          <br />
          <br />
          Ricciardo once again finished seventh at the Italian Grand Prix,
          having held off Grosjean in the dying laps. More tenth places followed
          at India and the Brazilian Grand Prix. Ricciardo out-scored his
          teammate by seven points and out-qualified him for over three-quarters
          of the season. His impressive qualifying efforts of 30-7 against
          Vergne over their two years together helped promote him to Toro Rosso
          senior team, Red Bull, replacing fellow countryman Mark Webber.
          Ricciardo finished 13th in the championship with 20 points.

          Ricciardo replaced Mark Webber at Infiniti Red Bull Racing at the
          start of the 2014 Formula One season, partnering Sebastian Vettel, a
          four-time world champion.

          In the first race of the season, the Australian Grand Prix, Ricciardo
          qualified in second place behind Lewis Hamilton and completed the race
          in second place, despite pressure from rookie Kevin Magnussen in the
          final laps. Ricciardo was later disqualified, as his car was ruled to
          have exceeded the mandated hourly fuel flow rate limit. Had he not
          been disqualified, it would have marked the first time an Australian
          had made the podium at the Australian Grand Prix since the race became
          part of the World Championship. Infiniti Red Bull Racing filed an
          appeal against the disqualification, which was rejected by the
          International Court of Appeal, the FIA decision being upheld.
          <br />

          Ricciardo failed to finish in the Malaysian Grand Prix, but managed to
          record his first points of the 2014 season at the Bahrain Grand Prix,
          where he finished fourth, after starting in 13th position. He finished
          fourth again at the Chinese Grand Prix. Ricciardo would not wait long
          for his first podium, securing third place at the Spanish Grand Prix.
          Monaco saw Ricciardo qualify in third, behind both Mercedes cars.
          Despite dropping to fifth early on, he regained third after problems
          for teammate Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen. He narrowly lost to Lewis
          Hamilton to second place by 0.4 seconds.
          <br />
          <br />
          At the Canadian Grand Prix, Ricciardo leaped from sixth on the grid to
          third during the pit stops, and in the last four laps, he overcame
          Sergio Pérez and Nico Rosberg to take his first win of his career. By
          winning, Ricciardo became the fourth Australian to win a Grand Prix in
          Formula One, joining Jack Brabham, Alan Jones and Mark Webber. His
          victory in Canada broke the chain of six Mercedes victories that
          marked the beginning of the 2014 season. Ricciardo impressed many by
          beating Vettel throughout the first half of the 2014 season, and after
          a clean and tight battle between Ricciardo and Fernando Alonso at the
          German Grand Prix, Alonso described Ricciardo as "unbelievable" and
          "very, very smart, very respectful".
          <br />
          <br />
          Ricciardo won the Hungarian Grand Prix on 27 July, ahead of Alonso and
          Hamilton having started fourth. He was in third place behind Alonso
          and Hamilton with less than four laps remaining and overtook
          Hamilton's Mercedes with a pass on the outside of the Hungaroring's
          turn two. He then easily caught and passed Alonso's Ferrari, as Alonso
          had very little grip left on his tyres - television footage of his
          left front tyre after the race showed it to be badly blistered. In the
          final two laps, Ricciardo pulled away to win the race by 5.225
          seconds. His teammate Vettel survived a spin coming onto the main
          straight late in the race to finish seventh. Ricciardo became the
          second Australian to win the Hungarian Grand Prix, after Mark Webber's
          victory - also for Red Bull - in 2010. Ricciardo then went on to score
          his third victory of his career to go back to back in Belgium, after
          the two Mercedes drivers collided. This meant he was the first
          Australian to win there since Jack Brabham in 1960.
          <br />
          <br />
          Ricciardo finished the Italian Grand Prix in fifth place, after a
          tense battle with teammate Vettel during the late stages of the race.
          At the Singapore Grand Prix, he qualified third and finished in the
          same position.
          <br />
          <br />
          On 4 October 2014, it was announced that Ricciardo would partner
          Daniil Kvyat for the 2015 season, following the announcement of
          Vettel's departure from the team. He took his final podium of the year
          at the United States Grand Prix. Ricciardo confirmed third place in
          the drivers' championship at the Brazilian Grand Prix, despite it
          being his first retirement since the Malaysian Grand Prix. He was
          forced to retire on lap 39 due to a broken suspension. In the final
          race of the season, the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, despite starting from
          the pit lane due to a front wing infringement, Ricciardo finished in
          fourth place and secured the first fastest lap of his Formula One
          career. For his 2014 performances, Ricciardo won the Laureus World
          Sports Award for Breakthrough of the Year in April 2015. Throughout
          the 2014 season, Ricciardo harnessed a total of 238 points, three wins
          and five more podiums.

        <p>
          On 8 February 2015, during the third episode of series 22 of the
          popular British motoring television programme Top Gear, Ricciardo
          became the fastest Formula One driver to perform a lap of the Top Gear
          test track during the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car feature, beating
          the previous record-holder Lewis Hamilton with a time of 1:42.2.
          <br />
          <br />
          In 2015, Red Bull slipped behind Ferrari and Williams in their efforts
          to take the title fight to Mercedes. The Red Bull cars were held back
          by the Renault power unit having been out-developed by Mercedes and
          Ferrari. The RB11 only showed pace in slow and twisty high downforce
          tracks or rain, highlighting the car's strong chassis.
          <br />
          <br />
          He finished the opening race at the Australian Grand Prix in sixth,
          the RB11 seemingly uncompetitive as he finished a lap down. Despite
          scoring many points in the first part of the year, Ricciardo's engine
          blew up on the final lap of the Bahrain Grand Prix, while running in
          sixth, forcing him to use his fourth and final engine of the year.
          Ricciardo achieved his first top-five finish in Monaco with fifth and
          the fastest lap of the race. He had a woeful race at the Canadian
          Grand Prix, where he finished 13th after being hit by car issues.
          <br />
          <br />
          While tussling for second in Hungary with Nico Rosberg, his
          race-winning charge ground to a halt when the two clashed while
          hunting down Sebastian Vettel. Ricciardo managed to finish third
          behind his teammate. It was his first podium since the 2014 United
          States Grand Prix. Ricciardo recorded his second podium of the season
          in Singapore, where he finished second and recorded his third fastest
          lap of the season.
          <br />
          <br />
          Ricciardo finished the season with 92 points in eighth place in the
          championship, three points behind teammate Daniil Kvyat. Despite
          out-qualifying Kvyat 14-5, Ricciardo trailed him 10-9 in races.

        <p>
          In a much more competitive Red Bull, Ricciardo began the season well,
          finishing 4th in both Australia and Bahrain and qualifying 2nd and
          then leading early on in the Chinese Grand Prix before suffering a
          tyre blowout and finishing in 4th again. Ricciardo qualified third at
          the Spanish Grand Prix, and after the two Mercedes cars of Lewis
          Hamilton and Nico Rosberg crashed out on the first lap, he led the
          early stages of the race. After a remarkable strategy call by Ferrari
          resulting in a very short third stint for Sebastian Vettel, Red Bull
          decided to answer this by pitting Ricciardo again and covering Vettel,
          also going for the presumed faster three-stop strategy. This dropped
          him behind Vettel, new teammate Max Verstappen and Kimi Räikkönen on
          track, and after a few failed attempts at passing Vettel, a tyre
          blowout late on in the race meant that he finished fourth again,
          behind eventual winner Verstappen, and the Ferraris of Räikkönen and
          Vettel.
          <br />
          <br />
          Ricciardo scored his first pole position at the Monaco Grand Prix, and
          led the early wet stages of the race. However, after a very long
          pitstop in which his team took nearly 40 seconds to ready a set of
          tyres, he lost the race lead to Lewis Hamilton and finished the race
          in 2nd. Ricciardo was notably upset after the race result, saying:
          "Two weekends in a row I've been screwed now. It sucks. It hurts."A
          pair of seventh-place finishes followed in Canada and Azerbaijan. A
          fourth place at the British Grand Prix would soon come, having been
          outqualified by a teammate for the first time that year. Ricciardo
          returned to the podium in Hungary, finishing third, and in Germany,
          where he finished second. On the podium in Germany, Ricciardo
          performed a new celebration, where he drank champagne out of his shoe.
          He calls this celebration the "shoey". He repeated the celebration at
          the Belgian Grand Prix (where he came second again), this time
          persuading podium interviewer Mark Webber to also drink from the shoe.
          Ricciardo qualified and finished second at the Singapore Grand Prix,
          after pushing eventual winner Rosberg hard near the end, a late
          strategy change pushing him to under half a second behind at the
          finish line.
          <br />
          <br />
          Ricciardo qualified fourth at the Malaysian Grand Prix but moved up to
          second into turn one, after a collision between Sebastian Vettel and
          Nico Rosberg. He then took the lead late on in the race when leader
          Lewis Hamilton retired with an engine failure. After fighting with his
          Red Bull teammate Verstappen, Ricciardo took his first victory of the
          season. He repeated his "shoey" celebration on the podium and was able
          to get team boss Christian Horner as well as podium sharers Verstappen
          and Rosberg to repeat the celebration. He finished third at the United
          States Grand Prix. Ricciardo eventually sealed third in the Drivers'
          Championship following a podium finish in Mexico. He scored 256 points
          and achieved one pole, one win, seven other podiums and three fastest
          laps. Other than Sergio Pérez, he is the only driver to have been
          classified in every race of the 2016 season.

        <p>
          Ricciardo qualified 10th in Australia after spinning into the tyre
          barrier in Q3. He incurred a five-place grid penalty due to an
          unscheduled gearbox change as a result of the crash. A gearbox sensor
          issue prevented him from taking the start and when he did get going,
          two laps down, a sudden fuel pressure problem ended his race after 25
          laps. In China, Ricciardo would finish fourth after narrowly losing
          out to teammate Max Verstappen on the last lap. Starting fourth at the
          Bahrain Grand Prix, and after a poor safety car restart which dropped
          him three places, he was able to pass Felipe Massa and finish in
          fifth. He endured a second retirement in four races at the Russian
          Grand Prix, pulling out on lap 5 due to brake issues. Ricciardo scored
          his first podium of the year, with third in Spain, albeit finishing
          over a minute behind the leaders. This marked the start of five
          consecutive podiums. He qualified fifth at the Monaco Grand Prix, and
          a strong overcut allowed him to jump Verstappen and Valtteri Bottas
          for another third place. Yet another third place followed in Canada
          after jumping Kimi Räikkönen, and inheriting positions after Vettel
          stopped for a front wing change and Verstappen retired.
          <br />
          <br />
          At the first Azerbaijan Grand Prix, Ricciardo qualified tenth having
          hit the wall. Ricciardo pitted early on lap 5 due to brake issues, and
          was down to 17th. However, he would charge back to the top 10 in a
          matter of laps, and sat fifth at the time of the red flag. Following
          the restart, Ricciardo made a sensational three-car overtake that
          moved him to third place, sitting behind Vettel and Lewis Hamilton.
          However, Vettel was due to serve a stop/go penalty while Hamilton
          pitted due to a loose headrest, promoting Ricciardo into the lead. He
          would then cross the line and win the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, four
          seconds ahead of Bottas. At Austria, Ricciardo got past Räikkönen on
          the opening lap for third, and held off Hamilton for his fifth podium
          on the bounce. Ricciardo took a five-place grid penalty for the
          British Grand Prix due to a gearbox change, but he suffered a turbo
          failure in Q1, relegating to 19th on the grid. In a stunning drive,
          Ricciardo produced a comeback that saw him climb fourteen places to
          fifth place. His run of form came to a halt at the Hungarian Grand
          Prix, as he and teammate Verstappen collided at Turn 2 on the opening
          lap, causing Ricciardo's radiator to break and spin out a corner
          later.
          <br />
          <br />
          Ricciardo stood on the podium in third place at the Belgian Grand
          Prix, having made up a place on Bottas during the second safety car
          restart from sixth on the grid. However the next race in Italy forced
          Ricciardo to take additional power unit elements, which necessitated a
          20-place grid penalty. He qualified third, but was demoted to 16th.
          Making yet another drive through the field, Ricciardo performed
          spectacular overtakes to end in fourth place. In Singapore, from
          third, He would inherit second at the start after a multi-car shunt,
          which was where he would finish. Malaysia delivered another podium in
          third place, after front-row starter Räikkönen was unable to take the
          start, and secured third again in Japan. This was followed by
          consecutive retirements in United States and Mexico.
          <br />
          <br />
          At the Brazilian Grand Prix, Ricciardo took another engine penalty
          that relegated him to 14th on the grid. He was caught up in a spin at
          the start by being tagged by Stoffel Vandoorne, but would still vault
          up to finish in sixth place. Despite having maintained fourth in the
          drivers' championship for much of the season, a third retirement in
          the last four races at Abu Dhabi saw Ricciardo drop down to fifth in
          the championship, with 200 points, five points behind Räikkönen.
          Ricciardo had scored one win, one fastest lap and nine podiums.

        <p>
          Ricciardo started the season with a fourth-place in Australia, from
          eighth on the grid after a three-place penalty for speeding under red
          flag conditions. In Bahrain, he recorded a non-finish after an
          electrical failure on the second lap. His result in the 2018 Chinese
          Grand Prix was much better, taking a commanding victory by almost nine
          seconds, after starting sixth on the grid. Running sixth for majority
          of the race, he and teammate Max Verstappen both pitted for fresher
          tyres under the safety car on lap 30. Ricciardo would put on an
          overtaking masterclass, overtaking five cars in a span of eight laps
          to win the race. At the 2018 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, Ricciardo
          qualified in fourth. He was fighting for fourth with teammate Max
          Verstappen in the latter half of the race. On lap 40, both drivers
          collided, Ricciardo's front wing made heavy contact with his
          teammate's rear, and the incident caused both drivers to retire.
          Following the race, Horner stated that both drivers were ordered to
          "apologise" at the Red Bull factory.
          <br />
          <br />
          At the Spanish Grand Prix, Ricciardo finished fifth and set the track
          record, despite spinning under the virtual safety car. Coming into the
          2018 Monaco Grand Prix, Ricciardo and Verstappen were considered
          favourites to win the race due to their cars superior chassis and
          down-force. Ricciardo topped all three practice sessions before
          qualifying, breaking the lap record with each session. Ricciardo
          managed to secure the second pole of his career at Monaco, topping
          every qualifying session as well and setting a new lap record again.
          In the race, Ricciardo managed to hold off the Ferrari of Sebastian
          Vettel to take his first Monaco Grand Prix victory and his first Grand
          Prix win from pole position, despite having to manage a loss of power
          due to a MGU-K power output issue throughout the race. His result
          would lift him to third in the standings, but his win would turn out
          to be his last podium of the season. He was set for a grid penalty at
          the Canadian Grand Prix due to his damaged MGU-K, but Red Bull opted
          to re-use his other from China. Starting sixth, After jumping Kimi
          Räikkönen at the start, a successful overcut on Lewis Hamilton brought
          him to fourth place at the finish.
          <br />
          <br />
          Front wing damage mid-race limited progress in France, as he was
          passed by Räikkönen late in the race which demoted him out of the
          podium positions, eventually settling for fourth again. More
          disappointment came on his birthday weekend at Austrian Grand Prix,
          retiring with an exhaust failure on lap 54. An uncompetitive weekend
          followed at the British Grand Prix, finishing fifth after a DRS
          failure in qualifying. He started the German Grand Prix from the back
          of the grid after changing power unit components, but suffered yet
          another engine failure during the race. Bad luck continue to befall
          Ricciardo in Hungary, as a spin for Lance Stroll early in a wet
          session prevented him from completing a clean lap, knocking him out in
          Q2. Despite contact on lap 1 with Marcus Ericsson, Ricciardo managed
          to progress to fifth place at the halfway mark. He would later make
          contact again with a damaged Valtteri Bottas on lap 68, but passed him
          back on the final lap for fourth place.
          <br />
          <br />
          On 3 August, Ricciardo announced his shock departure from Red Bull at
          the end of 2018. Ricciardo would suffer consecutive retirements in
          Belgium and Italy, being caught up in a first-lap incident in the
          former and sustaining a clutch issue in the latter. This was followed
          by two sixth places in succession, the latter race at the Russian
          Grand Prix saw Ricciardo start at the back for a third time due to
          engine penalties. At the Japanese Grand Prix, Ricciardo suffered
          another qualifying setback, being hit by an exhaust failure that
          confined him to 15th on the grid, having failed to set a lap in Q2.
          Fortunately, Ricciardo replicated his Hungary drive and pushed all the
          way to fourth place. Later in the season, he tied for the most
          retirements in the 2018 season, with 8 retirements in total. At the
          United States Grand Prix, Ricciardo outqualified Verstappen for the
          first time since Monaco in fifth, the Dutchman endured suspension
          issues. However, his run of mechanical retirements hit him on lap 9,
          pulling over with a battery failure.
          <br />
          <br />
          Ricciardo secured pole at the Mexican Grand Prix ahead of teammate
          Verstappen by a mere 0.027 seconds. A slow start dropped him to third,
          and was later passed by Vettel following the pit stops. Ricciardo did
          manage to catch up to Hamilton to reclaim third place, but to no avail
          as his car suffered a hydraulics issue on lap 61, forcing him to
          retire for an eighth time, tied for the most retirements in the 2018
          season. After the race, Ricciardo insisted that his car was cursed and
          said that he "didn't see the point" in doing the final two races of
          the season. An engine penalty in Brazil dropped him to 11th, and
          narrowly missed the podium to Räikkönen by 0.4 seconds in another
          stunning charge. Ricciardo finished fourth again at the season-ending
          Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after a wrong strategy meant he finished fourth
          again. He managed four fastest laps for the season, in Australia,
          China, Spain and Hungary and finished the season sixth in the World
          Drivers' Championship with 170 points.

          On 3 August 2018, it was announced that Ricciardo had signed a
          contract to drive for Renault in 2019 and 2020. His teammate for the
          2019 season was Nico Hülkenberg. Ricciardo had a poor start to the
          season with retirements in the first two races, from front wing damage
          in Australia and power failure in Bahrain, having run well in the
          points in the latter race. A first Q3 appearance followed in China
          followed, before driving to his first points finish with Renault in
          seventh place. In Azerbaijan, Ricciardo reversed into Daniil Kvyat
          when both cars stopped after an overtake attempt by Ricciardo, causing
          race-ending damage for both drivers and Ricciardo's third retirement
          in four races. Six consecutive race finishes followed, he finished
          13th at the Spanish Grand Prix after a questionable race strategy. He
          had his best qualifying thus far with sixth in Monaco, but a late call
          to pit before the safety car, dropped to ninth at the flag. Ricciardo
          had a successful weekend in Canada, improving his personal best
          qualifying position to fourth. He proceeded to finish in sixth place,
          having held off a faster Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas for numerous
          laps.
          <br />
          <br />
          Ricciardo crossed the line in seventh place at the French Grand Prix
          having been embroiled in a four-car battle, but was given two separate
          five-second penalties on the final lap. This was for failing to
          re-join the track safely after overtaking Lando Norris, and then
          overtook Kimi Räikkönen off-track, resulting in him being dropped out
          of the points. After a perplexing race in Austria, Ricciardo started
          and finished seventh at the British Grand Prix. He then suffered an
          exhaust failure at the German Grand Prix. More woes followed in
          Hungarian as he suffered a disastrous Q1 exit, and was then stuck
          behind Kevin Magnussen's Haas throughout the latter half of the race.
          <br />
          <br />
          Ricciardo took a five-place grid penalty at the Belgian Grand Prix due
          to a new engine, demoting him to tenth on the grid. A collision at the
          start with Lance Stroll caused significant damage to his car, and
          despite an audacious strategy that saw him as high as seventh, he
          would plummet down to 14th place At the Italian Grand Prix, Ricciardo
          qualified fifth, and despite losing out to teammate Hülkenberg at the
          start, he would get him back on lap 5. A spin for Sebastian Vettel
          ahead meant Ricciardo finished in fourth place, his best result of the
          year. Hülkenberg finished in fifth, contributing to Renault's best
          finish since the team returned to the sport in 2016. Ricciardo
          qualified eighth for the Singapore Grand Prix but was disqualified due
          to exceeding the MGU-K power limit during Q1, relegating him to the
          back. He had an eventful race, moving up to 12th by lap 10 but then
          suffering a puncture after contact with Antonio Giovinazzi. Following
          that, Ricciardo was embroiled in multiple battles and came home for
          14th place.
          <br />
          <br />
          Ricciardo was involved in a first-lap collision in Russia, leading to
          his eventual retirement. Ricciardo charged from 16th to sixth place in
          Japan after an excellent final stint. However, both Renault cars were
          disqualified ten days later for using illegal driver aids. From 13th
          in Mexico, Ricciardo finished in eighth place having pressured Sergio
          Pérez's Racing Point towards the end. He would follow this with strong
          6th-place finishes in the United States and Brazil. This was despite
          spinning Kevin Magnussen around in the latter race, in which Ricciardo
          would sustain front wing damage and also earn a five-second penalty.
          He wrapped up with 11th place at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
          <br />
          <br />
          Ricciardo ended a relatively disappointing season for Renault in ninth
          place in the championship, with 54 points, ahead of teammate
          Hülkenberg.

        <p>
          Ricciardo had a new teammate for the 2020 season, with Hülkenberg
          being replaced by Esteban Ocon.
          <br />
          <br />
          Daniel started the season with a retirement at the 2020 Austrian Grand
          Prix after his Renault R.S.20 overheated. In this next race, the 2020
          Styrian Grand Prix, Ricciardo was running in sixth place with two laps
          remaining, but was overtaken by Lance Stroll and Lando Norris. He
          finished the race in eighth. Ricciardo qualified eleventh at the 2020
          Hungarian Grand Prix and finished the race in eighth place.
          <br />
          <br />
          At the 2020 British Grand Prix, Ricciardo finished in fourth place,
          equaling his best result for Renault. He was running in sixth place
          before late tyre punctures for Carlos Sainz Jr. and Valtteri Bottas
          promoted him to fourth. At the 70th Anniversary Grand Prix, Ricciardo
          qualified fifth, but spun midway through the race and finished
          fourteenth. Ricciardo qualified thirteenth and finished eleventh at
          the next race in Spain.
          <br />
          <br />
          Ricciardo would go on an eleven-race point-scoring streak until the
          end of the season, starting with the 2020 Belgian Grand Prix. He
          qualified and finished in fourth place, as well as taking the fastest
          lap on the last lap of the race. At the 2020 Italian Grand Prix, he
          qualified seventh and finished in sixth place. At the 2020 Tuscan
          Grand Prix, he qualified eighth and was running in third place for the
          majority of the race, but was overtaken by Alex Albon of Red Bull,
          leaving him to have to finish in fourth place.
          <br />
          <br />
          At the Russian Grand Prix, Ricciardo was fastest in the second
          qualifying segment, but only managed to qualify in fifth place. In the
          race, he finished in fifth place despite a 5-second penalty for
          violating track limits. At the 2020 Eifel Grand Prix, Ricciardo
          qualified sixth and finished third, scoring the team's first podium
          since the 2011 Malaysian Grand Prix. This was Ricciardo's first podium
          since joining Renault, and his first since the 2018 Monaco Grand Prix.
          In the next race, the 2020 Portuguese Grand Prix, he started tenth
          after having a crash towards the end of the second segment of
          qualifying, damaging his rear wing. He finished ninth in the race. He
          reached the podium a second time for Renault at the 2020 Emilia
          Romagna Grand Prix. Starting fifth on the grid, he overtook Pierre
          Gasly on the first lap, before being overcut by Pérez after being
          stuck behind traffic. However, a tyre failure and the retirement of
          former teammate Max Verstappen and a strategy error by Pérez's team
          Racing Point allowed him to finish in third place. In the 2020 Bahrain
          Grand Prix, he started sixth and overtook Valtteri Bottas on the first
          lap. However, following a red flag, he had a poor second start, which
          dropped him down to tenth place. He eventually finished in seventh
          place. At the 2020 Sakhir Grand Prix, he had a chance of a podium
          after Charles Leclerc, Max Verstappen, and Sergio Pérez all collided
          in the first lap of the race. But a mistimed second pit stop caused
          Ricciardo to be overtaken, ending the race in fifth place. In his
          final race for Renault at the 2020 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, he qualified
          twelfth; however, a good first stint allowed him to exit the pits in
          seventh place. He also took the fastest lap of the race on the final
          lap. He finished in fifth place in the championship standings with 119
          points, six points behind Sergio Pérez in fourth.
