			<h2>Daniel Ricciardo - Full Biography</h2>

			<h3>Early life</h3>
			<p>
				Daniel Joseph Ricciardo was born on 1 July 1989 in Perth, Western Australia, to Italian-Australian
				parents. His father, Giuseppe "Joe" Ricciardo, was born in Ficarra (Messina), but relocated to Australia with
				his family at the age of seven. Ricciardo's mother, Grace Pulitanò was born in Australia, but had parents
				originally
				from Casignana (Calabria). Ricciardo also has a sister, Michelle. Growing up in Duncraig,
				Ricciardo's earliest memories of motorsports were of his father racing at the nearby Barbagallo Raceway in
				Wanneroo. Raised Catholic, he attended high school at Newman College. He started karting at the age
				of 9.

			<h3>Early career</h3>
			<br>
			<h4>Karting, Formula Ford and Formula BMW</h4>
			<p>
				Ricciardo started karting at the age of nine as a member of the Tiger Kart Club (TKC) and entered numerous
				karting events.
				<br>
				In 2005, he entered the Western Australian Formula Ford championship driving a 15-year-old Van
				Diemen, finishing eighth by the season's end.
				<br>
				<br>
				Towards the end of the 2005 season, Ricciardo took a leased 13-year-old Van Diemen across to Sandown Raceway in
				Melbourne to compete at the national Formula Ford series, but his aging car was uncompetitive, and he finished
				16th, 17th and retired during the weekend's three races.
				<br>
				<br>
				That year, Ricciardo was more successful in karts, in which he was crowned the Australian champion. His prizes
				for the win included a pass to the 2006 Australian Grand Prix at Albert Park, Melbourne, where the
				then-16-year-old savoured a taste of his own future by chatting unnoticed with Italian driver Jarno Trulli and
				Miss Universe 2004, Jennifer Hawkins.
				<br>
				<br>
				After finishing sixth in 2007 Formula Renault 2.0 Italia, Ricciardo was selected by the Red Bull Junior Team.
			</p>

			<h4>Formula Three</h4>
			<p>
				During the mid-part of the 2008 season, Ricciardo made his Formula Three debut at the Nürburgring, joining SG
				Formula's Formula 3 Euro Series team. Despite only a short amount of experience in the car, Ricciardo qualified
				in eighth for the first race, which later converted into sixth in the race after James Jakes and Christian
				Vietoris stalled on the grid. But he struggled in the reverse-grid race, finishing just fifteenth.
				<br>
				<br>
				Ricciardo moved to the British Formula 3 Championship for the 2009 season driving for Carlin Motorsport.
				Ricciardo continued his partnership with Carlin by heading to the Macau Grand Prix with the team.
			</p>

			<h4>Formula Renault 3.5 Series</h4>
			<p>
				On 30 October 2009, Ricciardo was signed by Tech 1 to compete in the 2010 season. He had competed with the
				team at the Autódromo Internacional do Algarve in Portugal in 2009 and was the teammate to Brendon Hartley,
				another driver who drove for Tech 1 over the season.
				<br>
				<br>
				Following a minor incident during a mountain bike exercise, Ricciardo was forced to miss the second test of the
				2010 season but went on to take pole position for both races at the season-opening round of the 2010 season in
				Alcañiz, Spain. He finished third and second in the races respectively, to leave himself at the head of the
				championship standings. Two weeks later, at the Spa-Francorchamps circuit, Ricciardo was relegated to last on
				the grid after being deemed to have hindered the laps of other drivers. In the next two races, he finished 13th
				and fifth respectively coming 2nd in the latter, until many of the front-runners were given penalties for
				infringing the parc ferme rules before the race. One week later, in Monte Carlo, Ricciardo secured his third
				pole position of the season, finishing three-tenths of a second ahead of championship rival Stefano Coletti. He
				secured his first win at the following race, one place ahead of Coletti. Ricciardo went on to secure two more
				wins at the Hungaroring and at the Hockenheimring in commanding fashion. Following Ricciardo's sixth pole from
				12 races, Tech 1 team boss, Simon Abadie, praised his driver's efforts greatly, saying, "I am happy, and happy
				for Daniel because six poles in 12 races is good going," and later stated his team's ambitions for success, by
				telling Autosport correspondent Peter Mills, "I really hope Daniel wins the championship."
				<br>
				<br>
				At the first race at the Silverstone circuit, Ricciardo was involved in a spectacular incident with pole-sitter
				Jon Lancaster, in which Ricciardo was sent into a barrel roll, eventually landing on his wheels. The crash saw
				the end of his race, with teammate Jean-Éric Vergne becoming the eventual winner, following disqualifications.
				Securing pole for the second race of the weekend, Ricciardo spent much of the race leading the pack by upwards
				of three seconds. However, braking issues in the second half of the event meant that, on the final lap,
				championship-rival Esteban Guerrieri was able to pass the Tech 1 racer.
				<br>
				<br>
				Going into the final round of the season, Ricciardo sat just three points behind championship leader Mikhail
				Aleshin and 13 ahead of third-place man Esteban Guerrieri. Managing his 8th pole of the season, Ricciardo
				managed a lights-to-flag victory, setting the fastest lap and placing himself equal first with one race
				remaining. After securing second place on the grid for the second race of the weekend, Ricciardo managed to
				hold position until the pit stops, where he was successfully 'jumped' by two of his rivals, including teammate
				Vergne. With only two laps left in the race and struggling for pace, Ricciardo was overtaken by championship
				rival Aleshin. Finishing in that order, Ricciardo failed to secure the title in his debut year, losing out to
				Mikhail Aleshin by only two points.
				<br>
				<br>
				In 2011 Ricciardo raced for ISR Racing prior to his HRT call-up.

			<br>
			<h3>Formula One career</h3>
			<br>
			<h4>Debut as Red Bull test driver (2009-2011)</h4>
			<p>
				Ricciardo made his track debut at the wheel of a Formula One car when he tested for Red Bull Racing at the
				young drivers test at Circuito de Jerez over three days, starting on 1 December 2009.
				<br>
				On the final day of testing, he clocked the fastest time of the test by over a second. This placed him as the
				only driver to go into
				the 1:17 bracket.
				<br>
				Red Bull Racing's team manager Christian Horner suggested that Ricciardo may replace his
				2010 World Series teammate Hartley as the team's test and reserve driver.
				Ricciardo and Hartley went on to share test and reserve duties for both Red Bull and sister team Scuderia Toro
				Rosso until the latter was
				removed from the Red Bull Junior team.
				<br>
				<br>
				On 11 November 2010, Ricciardo was confirmed as the single driver to represent Red Bull Racing at the
				end-of-season young driver's test at the Yas Marina Circuit, on 16-17 November. Ricciardo continued to show
				his one-lap prowess and dominated the event, with his fastest lap being 1.3 seconds faster than 2010 World
				Champion Sebastian Vettel's qualifying lap the Saturday before.
				<br>
				<br>
				Days later, Ricciardo was confirmed as Toro Rosso's test and reserve driver for the 2011 season and would take
				part in the first free practice session of each race weekend. Franz Tost, Toro Rosso team principal
				stated that "having a hungry youngster on the books will keep our current driver pairing nice and sharp",
				referring to then Toro Rosso drivers Jaime Alguersuari and Sébastien Buemi.

			</div>
			<br>

			<h4>HRT (2011)</h4>
			<p>
				On 30 June 2011, Ricciardo was contracted to Hispania Racing by Red Bull Racing, replacing Narain Karthikeyan
				for the remaining races of the 2011 season (excepting the Indian Grand Prix, to allow Karthikeyan to race at his
				home Grand Prix). Ricciardo made his Grand Prix debut at the 2011 British Grand Prix at Silverstone
				Circuit.
				<br>
				<br>
				However, on 22 October 2011, a few days before the inaugural Indian Grand Prix, the race where Karthikeyan was
				due to gain back his seat for his home race
				HRT F1 announced that Vitantonio Liuzzi made way for Karthikeyan,
				allowing Ricciardo to race in India and extend his learning curve that Red Bull Racing paid the struggling
				Spanish team to do, as well as allowing Karthikeyan to race in front of his home fans.
				<br>
				In Abu Dhabi, Ricciardo retired with mechanical problems after starting 20th on the grid, and in the final race
				at the Brazilian Grand Prix, Ricciardo finished 20th after starting 22nd on the grid.

			</div>
			<br>

			<h4>Toro Rosso (2012-2013)</h4>
			<p><strong>2012</strong></p>
			<p>
				On 14 December 2011, it was confirmed that Ricciardo would drive for Scuderia Toro Rosso for the 2012 season,
				alongside Frenchman Jean-Éric Vergne.
				<br>
				<br>
				At the Australian Grand Prix on 18 March, Ricciardo managed to overtake his teammate Vergne late on the last lap
				to come home in ninth place, securing his first two World Championship points.
				<br>
				<br>
				In wet conditions in Malaysia, he finished 12th, after having been first to switch to slick tyres. In Bahrain,
				he qualified sixth, but dropped back during the race and finished 15th. In Monaco, he suffered his only
				retirement of the season, after having started from 15th position. Ricciardo would score points again only
				after the summer break, at the Belgian Grand Prix, where he started from 16th and finished ninth. He
				also had a run of three consecutive points scores from the Singapore to the Korean Grand Prix. He
				scored one more points finish in Abu Dhabi for the year, ending tenth. Ricciardo finished 18th in the
				championship, with 10 points.

			<br>

			<p><strong>2013</strong></p>
			<p>
				Toro Rosso re-signed Ricciardo and Jean-Éric Vergne for the 2013 season.
				<br>
				<br>
				He began the year by not finishing the opening two rounds, both due to exhaust issues. In China, Ricciardo
				scored his first points of the year after finishing seventh, claiming his best finish in F1 by far. He
				finished tenth at the Spanish Grand Prix, despite a slow start from 11th on the grid. Ricciardo again was
				unable to finish the Monaco Grand Prix after Romain Grosjean crashed into the back of him, damaging his rear
				wing. At the British Grand Prix, Ricciardo had his best qualifying yet in fifth. Despite being overtaken
				by faster cars behind, he still snatched points with eighth place.
				<br>
				<br>
				Ricciardo once again finished seventh at the Italian Grand Prix, having held off Grosjean in the dying laps.
				More tenth places followed at India and the Brazilian Grand Prix. Ricciardo out-scored his teammate by seven
				points and out-qualified him for over three-quarters of the season. His impressive qualifying efforts of 30-7
				against Vergne over their two years together helped promote him to Toro Rosso senior team, Red Bull,
				replacing fellow countryman Mark Webber. Ricciardo finished 13th in the championship with 20 points.

			<br>

			<h4>Red Bull (2014-2018)</h4>
			<p>
				Ricciardo replaced Mark Webber at Infiniti Red Bull Racing at the start of the 2014 Formula One season,
				partnering Sebastian Vettel, a four-time world champion.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>2014: Breakthrough victory and third in the championship</strong></p>
			<p>
				In the first race of the season, the Australian Grand Prix, Ricciardo qualified in second place behind Lewis
				Hamilton and completed the race in second place, despite pressure from rookie Kevin Magnussen in the final
				laps. Ricciardo was later disqualified, as his car was ruled to have exceeded the mandated hourly fuel flow rate
				limit. Had he not been disqualified, it would have marked the first time an Australian had made the podium
				at the Australian Grand Prix since the race became part of the World Championship. Infiniti Red Bull Racing
				filed an appeal against the disqualification, which was rejected by the International Court of Appeal, the FIA
				decision being upheld.
				<br>
				<br>
				Ricciardo failed to finish in the Malaysian Grand Prix, but managed to record his first points of the 2014
				season at the Bahrain Grand Prix, where he finished fourth, after starting in 13th position. He finished
				fourth again at the Chinese Grand Prix. Ricciardo would not wait long for his first podium, securing third place
				at the Spanish Grand Prix. Monaco saw Ricciardo qualify in third, behind both Mercedes cars. Despite
				dropping to fifth early on, he regained third after problems for teammate Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen. He narrowly
				lost to Lewis Hamilton to second place by 0.4 seconds.
				<br>
				<br>
				At the Canadian Grand Prix, Ricciardo leaped from sixth on the grid to third during the pit stops, and in the
				last four laps, he overcame Sergio Pérez and Nico Rosberg to take his first win of his career. By winning,
				Ricciardo became the fourth Australian to win a Grand Prix in Formula One, joining Jack Brabham, Alan Jones and
				Mark Webber. His victory in Canada broke the chain of six Mercedes victories that marked the beginning of
				the 2014 season. Ricciardo impressed many by beating Vettel throughout the first half of the 2014 season,
				and after a clean and tight battle between Ricciardo and Fernando Alonso at the German Grand Prix, Alonso
				described Ricciardo as "unbelievable" and "very, very smart, very respectful".
				<br>
				<br>
				Ricciardo won the Hungarian Grand Prix on 27 July, ahead of Alonso and Hamilton having started fourth. He
				was in third place behind Alonso and Hamilton with less than four laps remaining and overtook Hamilton's
				Mercedes with a pass on the outside of the Hungaroring's turn two. He then easily caught and passed Alonso's
				Ferrari, as Alonso had very little grip left on his tyres - television footage of his left front tyre after the
				race showed it to be badly blistered. In the final two laps, Ricciardo pulled away to win the race by 5.225
				seconds. His teammate Vettel survived a spin coming onto the main straight late in the race to finish
				seventh. Ricciardo became the second Australian to win the Hungarian Grand Prix, after Mark Webber's victory
				- also for Red Bull - in 2010. Ricciardo then went on to score his third victory of his career to go back to
				back in Belgium, after the two Mercedes drivers collided. This meant he was the first Australian to win there
				since Jack Brabham in 1960.
				<br>
				<br>
				Ricciardo finished the Italian Grand Prix in fifth place, after a tense battle with teammate Vettel during the
				late stages of the race. At the Singapore Grand Prix, he qualified third and finished in the same position.
				<br>
				<br>
				On 4 October 2014, it was announced that Ricciardo would partner Daniil Kvyat for the 2015 season, following the
				announcement of Vettel's departure from the team. He took his final podium of the year at the United States
				Grand Prix. Ricciardo confirmed third place in the drivers' championship at the Brazilian Grand Prix,
				despite it being his first retirement since the Malaysian Grand Prix. He was forced to retire on lap 39 due to a
				broken suspension. In the final race of the season, the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, despite starting from the pit
				lane due to a front wing infringement, Ricciardo finished in fourth place and secured the first fastest lap of
				his Formula One career. For his 2014 performances, Ricciardo won the Laureus World Sports Award for
				Breakthrough of the Year in April 2015. Throughout the 2014 season, Ricciardo harnessed a total of 238
				points, three wins and five more podiums.

			<br>

			<p><strong>2015</strong></p>
			<p>
				On 8 February 2015, during the third episode of series 22 of the popular British motoring television programme
				Top Gear, Ricciardo became the fastest Formula One driver to perform a lap of the Top Gear test track during the
				Star in a Reasonably Priced Car feature, beating the previous record-holder Lewis Hamilton with a time of
				1:42.2.
				<br>
				<br>
				In 2015, Red Bull slipped behind Ferrari and Williams in their efforts to take the title fight to Mercedes. The
				Red Bull cars were held back by the Renault power unit having been out-developed by Mercedes and Ferrari. The
				RB11 only showed pace in slow and twisty high downforce tracks or rain,
				highlighting the car's strong chassis.
				<br>
				<br>
				He finished the opening race at the Australian Grand Prix in sixth, the RB11 seemingly uncompetitive as he
				finished a lap down. Despite scoring many points in the first part of the year, Ricciardo's engine blew up
				on the final lap of the Bahrain Grand Prix, while running in sixth, forcing him to use his fourth and final
				engine of the year. Ricciardo achieved his first top-five finish in Monaco with fifth and the fastest lap of
				the race. He had a woeful race at the Canadian Grand Prix, where he finished 13th after being hit by car
				issues.
				<br>
				<br>
				While tussling for second in Hungary with Nico Rosberg, his race-winning charge ground to a halt when the two
				clashed while hunting down Sebastian Vettel. Ricciardo managed to finish third behind his teammate. It was
				his first podium since the 2014 United States Grand Prix. Ricciardo recorded his second podium of the season in
				Singapore, where he finished second and recorded his third fastest lap of the season.
				<br>
				<br>
				Ricciardo finished the season with 92 points in eighth place in the championship, three points behind teammate
				Daniil Kvyat. Despite out-qualifying Kvyat 14-5, Ricciardo trailed him 10-9 in races.

			</div>
			<br>

			<p><strong>2016</strong></p>
			<p>
				In a much more competitive Red Bull, Ricciardo began the season well, finishing 4th in both Australia and
				Bahrain and qualifying 2nd and then leading early on in the Chinese Grand Prix before suffering a tyre blowout
				and finishing in 4th again. Ricciardo qualified third at the Spanish Grand Prix, and after the
				two Mercedes cars of Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg crashed out on the first lap, he led the early stages of
				the race. After a remarkable strategy call by Ferrari resulting in a very short third stint for Sebastian
				Vettel, Red Bull decided to answer this by pitting Ricciardo again and covering Vettel, also going for the
				presumed faster three-stop strategy. This dropped him behind Vettel, new teammate Max Verstappen and Kimi
				Räikkönen on track, and after a few failed attempts at passing Vettel, a tyre blowout late on in the race meant
				that he finished fourth again, behind eventual winner Verstappen, and the Ferraris of Räikkönen and Vettel.
				<br>
				<br>
				Ricciardo scored his first pole position at the Monaco Grand Prix, and led the early wet stages of the
				race. However, after a very long pitstop in which his team took nearly 40 seconds to ready a set of tyres,
				he lost the race lead to Lewis Hamilton and finished the race in 2nd. Ricciardo was notably upset
				after the race result, saying: "Two weekends in a row I've been screwed now. It sucks. It hurts."A pair of
				seventh-place finishes followed in Canada and Azerbaijan. A fourth place at the British Grand Prix
				would soon come, having been outqualified by a teammate for the first time that year. Ricciardo returned to
				the podium in Hungary, finishing third, and in Germany, where he finished second. On the podium in
				Germany, Ricciardo performed a new celebration, where he drank champagne out of his shoe. He calls this
				celebration the "shoey". He repeated the celebration at the Belgian Grand Prix (where he came second
				again), this time persuading podium interviewer Mark Webber to also drink from the shoe.
				Ricciardo qualified and finished second at the Singapore Grand Prix, after pushing eventual winner Rosberg hard
				near the end, a late strategy change pushing him to under half a second behind at the finish line.
				<br>
				<br>
				Ricciardo qualified fourth at the Malaysian Grand Prix but moved up to second into turn one, after a collision
				between Sebastian Vettel and Nico Rosberg. He then took the lead late on in the race when leader Lewis
				Hamilton retired with an engine failure. After fighting with his Red Bull teammate Verstappen, Ricciardo took
				his first victory of the season. He repeated his "shoey" celebration on the podium and was able
				to get team boss Christian Horner as well as podium sharers Verstappen and Rosberg to repeat the
				celebration. He finished third at the United States Grand Prix. Ricciardo eventually sealed third in
				the Drivers' Championship following a podium finish in Mexico. He scored 256 points and achieved one
				pole, one win, seven other podiums and three fastest laps. Other than Sergio Pérez, he is the only driver to
				have been classified in every race of the 2016 season.
